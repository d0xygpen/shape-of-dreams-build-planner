Pure White fires scaling light projectiles that gain 40% AoE splash from Pain, turning each projectile into group damage. Shock builds light stacks through bouncing lightning (16pt synergy with Pure White), making each Pure White empowered cast fire more projectiles. Wound on Golden Explosion marks enemies - after 3 hits they explode for 275% AoE. Golden Explosion's own damage triggers Wound marks, and Overload empowers it by 45%. Insight adds 200% Light damage and Memory Haste (18pt with Flow), accelerating the ability rotation. Celestial adds meteor damage to Starfall. Clemency leeches 4% from all the AoE damage for sustain. Overload naturally drops health, activating Resonance Effect and Autophagy bonuses.",
